122 LAELIUS DE AMICITIA

vius t1·anslateS‚ καὶ ἐν αὐτῷ δὲ ἵππῳ. Schiche’s conjecture now re-
ceives confirmation from the reading of C, ιῖη in ipso.l

29. 14. opera : the Mss.‚ followed by Mstller, have opere ,· and
so all editors except Reid, who rightly urges that opera is here
demanded by the sense.

31. Dispares enim mores disparia studia sequuntur: Miiller
puts a comma after mores, and takes both nouns (used as syno-
nyms) as the subject of sequuntur. With most recent editors Ι

remove the comma and interpret the sentence as explained in the ’

commentary.

30. 23. solvendae: I follow Novak-'s conjecture. The Mss.
have eluendae (C elevandae), followed by Miiller and all other
editors. But eluere, ‘ to wash out‚’ is· nowhere used of such things
as sonivium—only of blood, disgrace, ignoniiny, etc. The eor-
ruption of solvendae to eluendae would have been perfectly natural.
We have only to assume the haplography of ss and the change of o
to e. With the expression, cf. (mm'cz'cz'as dissolveret, p. 14, 1. 31.

31. 2. Nihil enim est: this is the reading of all Mss. except M.v
which has nihil esc enim, adopted by Miiller.

7. at cum bonitate: the Mss. give auctoritate followed by
Mulier. I have adopted Meis-sner's conjecture, which is not
merely paleographically simple, but yields excellent sense.

11. oppressae esse: this is the reading of all Mss. except M,
which omits esse. Miiller follows M.

16. non is: Miiller here omits is hy an oversight.

33. 17. deligendis: the Mss. give ‹li'lz'gsenllz'ss so Miiller and
most editors; but et. . . ec seems to indicate that we have not
synonymous expressions to deal with. l'etavius evidently had a
Ms. or edition which read (Ιρῖὶρρηᾱίς, for his translation is ἐπὶ τῆς
ἐκλογῆς καὶ θεραπείας.

35. 7. subeunda: Madvig’s conjecture for sublevanda of the
Mss. followed by Miiller. Even Miiller's elaborate note in defence
of the Ms. reading (Seyffert-llliiller, p. 511) does not persuade me

 

 

1 I read this τῇ] as quin. (despite ilie fact that the recognized ab·
breviation sor quin is qh), owing to ilie recurrence of the sanie ahhre-
viation at ξ (18 fin. ιῇι loa-is ipsis, where all other Mss. have quin
(1⁴1 qui in), long sim-0. corrected to cnm (Mii. quone).
