onmem. APPENDIX 119

percipi: this is the Ms. reading. Miillcr reads perspici after
Madvig. But percipi is used frequently in the sense demanded by
the context. For instances, see Merguet, Lexikon zu den philo-
sophischen Schriften Ciceros. ()f recent editors, Reid, Schiche,
Nauck, and Monet read pert-[pi.

11. 21. qua: this is the reading of all the Mss. except Ρ, which
reads (lucie, adopted by Miiller. It is perfectly true that quae is as
common or commoner in Cicero than qua as an indefinite pronoun
(see Neue, Formenlehre der lateinischen Sprache²3, ΙΙ, p. 407); yet
qua is frequent, and in the present passage seems to have decidedly
the stronger support.

15. 18. perducti essent: this is Meissner's conjecture. Miiller‚
following the Mss., reads perdurissmzl. Meissner defends his con-
jecture in Neue Jahrbiicher fiir Philologie und Padagogik, vol. 135,
p. 553 f. If we read pertimuissent, he points out that not only is
there a violent change of subject in the two successive verbs (pone-
rentur and perduxissent), but it is also necessary to supply an object
(cantores) with perclu.1·issenc; the subject is again violently changed
with ‹lz’rimz' (se. amores). Stylistically Meissner's conjecture is a
great improvement, while paleographically it is extremely simple
and plausible.

17. 4. memoriam: Miiller follows P and reads memoria, in
which he is followed by all recent editors except Reid. Editors
defend memoria by citing Cato quoted by Gellius, XIV, 2, 20. Atque
esso a maioribus memore'a sic accvpe',· and Cic. de Nat. Deo. ΙΙ, 37,
95, suscepissent (tutem sunm ec audicione esse quoddam numen et
vim deorum. But these cases are different; in the passage from
Cato, accepi is completed by sim in the pa'ssage from the de Nat.
Deo. the verb has a direct object in the infinitive. In the Laelius
passage we are called upon to accept accipere alone in the same use.

18. 2. quoquo: the reading of C (and earlier editors). P has
quoque; the other Mss. quoque quem. Miiller reads (suorumque.

5. Serpit clam ea res: the Mss. give Serme ‹leimla res, which
Mulier reads and marks as corrupt. My reading follows the con-
jecture of Deiter (Bursian's Jal11·esbe1·ieht,vol. 84, p. 79). The con-
fusion of initial cl with d is easy and of frequent occurrence in Mss.;
m also might easily become in, so that paleographically Deiter's
conjecture ((Ζαὶη ea > deinde) is very plausible.
