118 LAELIUS DE AMICITIA

therefore adopted the conjecture of Schiche and Strelitz,lgm-multis.
This seems to me superior to Miillcr's conjecture, force 11111ῖιι’5; 111
point ot* sense it 15 more natural, and paleographieally it 15 easier.
The Greek translation of l’etavius (Paris, 1553) has ὒς (50. λόγος)

ΡΙ) have utroque. followed by MUIIer, and all recent editors except
Reid. To omit vestrum would be to concede more authority to P
than it seems to me we are justified 111 attaching to that Ms.

6. 12. qui non tum hoc, tum illud. uti plerique: Miiller
gives the Ms. reading here: ([1ιὶ nun tum lwt', [11111 illud, 1ιι in ple-
risque, and marks the passage 115 corrupt. In this attitude he is
probably correct, as the omission ot' the verb of saying with qm* is
unparalleled. Some scholars defend the ellipsis, comparing such
stereotyped phrases as p. 1, l. lo, sed de hoc allas. But such com-
parisons do not seem to me to 1111111511 1118 necessary support for the
omission of <licebat 111 the passage before us. Gulielmius suggested
cui for qui and made this depend upon videbatur to be supplied
fron] videbatur below, changing also 111 [a plerisque to uti plerisque.
This conjecture has met with much favor, but it can hardly be
pronounced less violent than the proposal 10 understand dicebat.
Those who retain uc [11 plerisque, ⁴ as in most inatters,' explain it
as referring to Socrates’s habit of assuming a position now 011 0118
51118 of a subject⁷ now on the other, for the sake of argument. But
as Deiter well remarks (Bursian’s Jahresbericht, vol. 84, p. 79),
socrates was not 50 vacillating that in most cases he held now this
view, now that. The 0011111151 15 drawn rather between the views
of Socrates and the views of 0111015 touching the nature of the
human 50111. Hence Deiter himself had conjectured 111 plerique, a
reading found, according to Ramorino (Rivista di Filologia, XV,
2111 ), 111 a Milan Ms. collated by him. The conjecture uti plerique
15 Strelitz’s3 I have adopted it as being slightly nearcr the Mss.

10. 231. atque discordiis: Miiller reads acque er„ discordiis,
'l'he Ms. authority for eir, however. is slight, and tbc repetition

hit upon the same conjecture.
