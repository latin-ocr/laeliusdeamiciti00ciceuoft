vi INTRODUCTION

Sation naturally turns to Laelius's intimate friendship with
Scipio, and this in turn leads to the subject of friendship in
general, on which, at the request of the young men, Laelius
sets forth his views at length.

4. The Interlocutors:

(a) Laelius. Gaius Laelius was born shortly before 185 13.c.
Iu 155 13.C. his interest iu philosophy was first ronsed by listen—
ing to the teachings of three Greek philosophers‚-—Diogenes,
Critolaus, and Carneades,-who, having come to Rome on a
‹liplomatic errand, ventured to set forth to Roman youth the
tenets of their several schools. It was Stoicism which appealed
most strongly to Laelius, and he subsequently pursued his
studies in this field under Panaetius of Rhodes, the most impor-
tant representative of the Stoic school at that time. Entering
public life, he was tribune of the plebs 111 151 B.C., served in
the Third Punic War, and was present at the fall of Carthage
111 146 1³13. 3 the year following· he was elected praetor. In this
capacity 110 took the field and successfully conducted the Lusita—
nian campaign against Viriathus. The same year he was chosen
augur, and took a prominent part in opposing the movement to
change the existing method of electing the member-s of the au-
3111111 college. Ilitherto vacancies arising iu this board had been
filled by the augurs themselves. The tribune Crassus proposed
10 transfer the election to the people, but his plans were defeated
by Laelius (sce. ἓ ,(16 of the de Amicitia). Four years later
(111 110) Laelius was defeated as candidate for the consulship,
but was successful 1110 year afterward.

111 his general character Laelius combined (Greek ideality. lore
of literature and 111111051η111)Υ 011 1110 0110 hand‚with 10111311 00111-
mon-sense and wisdom in practical affairs ou the other. The
suruame Sapiens given him by his contempm‘aries was probably
intended 10 recognize 110111 these sides of his character. Person-
ally 110 was mild of manner. warm-hearted, and thoroughly
optimistic. For his relations with Scipio. see below. ξ 5.
