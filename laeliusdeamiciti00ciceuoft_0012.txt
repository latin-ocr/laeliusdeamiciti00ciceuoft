circle embracing his friend Laelius, L. Furius Philus, Scaevola
(the augur), Fannius, and. the poets Lucilius and Terence.
Rumor had it that he assisted Terence in the composition of
his comedies.

To Laelius, Scipio was attached by ties of the closest friend-
ship. At home and in the field the two were inseparable.
(di-ero in the Republic (I, 18) tells us that Laelius reverenced
Scipio as divine in consequence of his military prowess‚ while
Scipio 111 turn regarded Laelius as a father. Their views of life
and governinent were identical ; even the ohservations on friond-
ship which Cicero in this slialoguc puts in the mouth of Laelius
are expressly declared by the latter to he those of his friend.

l'olitically Scipio was a firm aristocrat. He had been ab·
sent in Spain at the time of the disturbances which culminated
in the murder of Tiberius Gracchus, hut on his return he spoke
ont boldly and, though married to Sempronia, ihc sister of
Gracchus, did not hesitate to declare his belief that the agitator
had been justly slain. This was in 1323 B.(·., and sor the four
remaining years of his life Scipio was the recognized leader of
the aristocratic party. One morning in 129 13.‹:. he was found
dead in his bed. thether he was the victim os violence or died
a natural death was never known. Suspicion pointed to foul
play at the hands of his political opponents. Rumor linkcd
itsclf especially with the names of Fulvius, Carbo, and the
younger Gracchus. Of these, Carbo was the most generally
suspected, and is even expressly mentioned by Cicero as the
author of the dced.
