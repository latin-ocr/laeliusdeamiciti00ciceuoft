PREFACE

—000—

Fon the text of this edition, Ι have endeavored to
utilize the critical material that has appeared since the
publication of Miiller⁷s edition (Leipsio, 1879). In the
eonimentary the aim has been to give only such infor-
mation as the student needs for an adequate under-
standing of. the text. All diseussion of inoot points,
whether of text or interpretation, has been relegated
to a Critieal Appendix.

In the preparation of the notes Ι have been espe-
cially aided by the excellent eommentaries of Reid,
Strefflsz, and Meissner.

To Professor Pease, Professor Alfred Gudeman, of
the University of Pennsylvania‚ Professor H. C. Ehner,
and Mr. Chas. L. Durhani, of Cornell University‚ I
wish also to extend aeknowledginent for valuable
assistance and advice.
