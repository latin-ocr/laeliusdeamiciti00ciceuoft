cm‘rICAL APPENDIX 121

after Mommsen, brackets these words, which are lacking in P,
but the passage has a genuine Ciceronian character, and ought, in
my judgment, to be regarded as sound.

23. 16. faciat: the Mss., followed by Δ11111161, read facit. But

⁸facz'ac is almost a syntactical necessity here, as is recognized by

Halm, Baiter, Meissner, Strelitz‚ 'l'iieking, Novak. At p. 24, 1. 3,
where the 3111116 sentence again occurs, all Mss. have faciat.

24. 9. inducat in spem: 111 support of the insertion of inl,
which no existing Ms. has, may be cited Petavius's translation, εἰς
τὸ ἄμεινον ἐλπίζειν.

25. 28. amicitiis: CDK have amz'cz'cz'z's,· EV, amicitl'a,· l'MG,
anze'‹·[t2'as‚· Rs, ann'tz'eias. I‘etavius evidently followed a text or
Ms. which read amiciciis,· his translation is ἵνα . . . ταῖς φιλίαις
χρησώμεθα.

32. Sint vero aliqui reperti: the Mss. vary considerably
here. MGBSV have 3ιή vero erunt, P has sinuer'mzt, DE have
sin erant. As the Latinity of sin vero is questionable for
Cicero's writings, Miiller reads sin erunt. My reading follows
H 2682.

26. 18. aut in bonis: the Mss. have (cuc si in bonis, fol-
lowed by Miiller and all other editors except Meissner. Ι follow
him in reJecting si, and consequently in putting a colon after
convincunt.

24. constantiaeque eius, quam in amicitia quaerimus, fides
est: this is my conjecture for the Ms. reading constantiaeque esc
eius, qaam in amz'cicz'a quaet-imm, fides, which puts est in a most
unnatural position. It is much simpler to believe that in the arohe-
type esc had fallen out after fides (at the end of a line ?) and was
then wrongly inserted after conscsmciaeque, In C constantiaeque
and fides both stand at the end of the line.

27. 32. Quin in ipso: the Mss. vary. P1·eadsqae'in; GBESV,
quin et 1’11,· D, atqui z'n. Miiller reads quin ipso. But the sense
of the passage makes in indispensable (see Meissner, Neue Jahr-
biicher fiir Philologie und Padagogik‚ 135, p. 555). My text follows
Schiche’s conjecture. Meissner himself reads In ipso. But his
plea that Cicero would not have used quin twice in such close en-
vironment can hardly have weight in face of the overwhelming
Ms. eviden'ce in favor of that word in the present passage. Peta-
