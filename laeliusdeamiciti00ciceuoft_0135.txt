Pliny, Epp. iv. 7. 11, subire offensas.

37. (ἱ. et severum: Miiller here follows MGDE which have
severum; BCSV have ec severam, the reading adopted by Halm,
Baiter, Meissner, Novak. Inasmuch as constantem, severum, and
(lo-(wem are independent and equal modifiers of ciuem, ec cannot
properly be omitted here.

10. illi: MGD, followed by Muner, have illa ,· PBCESV have
illi, adopted by Nauck, Reid, Novak, Monet. The position of the
pronoun, as well as the sense of the passage, seems to me to be
against Miiller's reading.

12. [non comitem] : bracketed by Graevius as an interpolation
fron] ,ξ 37, nec se comitem illv'zcsfecroris, sed ducem praebuit.

40. 1. alia ex alia: ex alia is Orelli's emendation; Ι follow
Miiller in accepting it. But it evidently antedates Orelli by several
centuries. Petavius translates ἄλλην ἐξ ἄλλης.
